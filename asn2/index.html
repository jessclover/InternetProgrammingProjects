  <h3>
    <b>Axolots: What Are They?</b>
  </h3>
  <p>An <b>axolotl</b> is a type of <i>salamander</i> that does not go through metamorphosis. Salamanders start off by living in the water.</p>
  <p>Usually salamanders go through a process in order to become adults called metamorphosis. When they go through this process, they replace thier gills for air-breathing lungs. It's like how tadpoles transform into frogs!</p>
  <p>Although axolotls never make this transition. Instead, they keep their gills and stay living in the water their entire life. Now even though axolotls may look like the tadpole form of many salamanders, they do become adults in the sense they are able to breed. They also will end up developing lungs but they still use their gills to breath.</p>
  <p>Many researchers believe that the way axolotls evolve is based on their environment and their limited resources.</p>
  <h3>
    <b>What do Axolots Eat and How Long do They Live?</b>
  </h3>
  <p>Axolotls are the top predators in their native habitats. They eat almost anything including crustanaceans, mollusks, worms, insect larva, and small fish.</p>
  <p> In the wild, axolotls can live up to 10-15 years! They can even reach up to 12 inches and weigh anywhere from 0.11-0.44 pounds.</p>
